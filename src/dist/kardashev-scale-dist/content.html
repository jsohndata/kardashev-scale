h2: Types of Civilizations

h3: Type I
A civilization that is able to harness and utilize all the energy available on its own planet. This would require the ability to harness energy from sources such as wind, water, and solar power.

h3: Type II
An advanced society with the capacity to harness and make use of the entirety of its star's energy emissions, achieved through the construction of a theoretical megastructure called a Dyson sphere, which encircles the star and captures its energy.

h3: Type III
A highly developed civilization has the ability to tap into and efficiently utilize the entire energy output of its galaxy by creating a theoretical megastructure known as a Dyson swarm. The concept involves a network of interconnected Dyson spheres.
