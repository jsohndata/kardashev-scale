    <h1>Kardashev Scale</h1>
    <p>Theoretical framework that measures the level of technological advancement of a civilization based on the amount of energy that it is able to harness and utilize. The scale was proposed in 1964 by the Russian astrophysicist, Nikolai Kardashev.</p>
    <p>To learn more about Kardashev Scale see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

          <summary><h2>Type I Civilization</h2></summary>
          <p>A civilization that is able to harness and utilize all the energy available on its own planet. This would require the ability to harness energy from sources such  as wind, water, and solar power.</p>

          <summary><h2>Type II Civilization</h2></summary>
          <p>A civilization that is able to harness and utilize all the energy emitted by its own star. This would require the ability to build a Dyson sphere, a hypothetical megastructure that surrounds a star and captures its energy output.</p>
